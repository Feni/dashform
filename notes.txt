Structure
	- New Application
		- Application as top level
	Sidebar is full of tables
	- New Table
		- Edit schema
			- Add field
			- Edit field
			- Remove field

		Right now the only definition is the field type. Nothing else. 
		Text. Number. 
			What about other types like percent, dollars, etc? Short text vs long text.
		- Manage data
			- Add data
			- Edit data
			- Remove data

I'll skip the application level right now and add that in later.

	/books - view list of books
		/add - add a book
		/edit - edit fields
