Questions: 
Typed vs untypes
	- Typed - One extra step on creation, more freedom on usage, can give special UI by type
	- Untyped: Simpler UI
Filtering
Views


Notes:
Don't let not knowing how the UI should look deter you from implementing it. Implement atleast the functionality and then you can iterate on the bits you don't know later.
